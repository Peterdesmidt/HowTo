   There are many ways to wash a Dog but I will be <br>
   showing you how to wash a dog the easiest way.<br>
   </p></p>
   <h

<b></h><h3 style="background-color:#73C6B6"> Step One </h3>                  
</h>
<p style="text-align:center" "> First you need to get a Dog. 
Then you need<br> to have a supply of water this could be a hose, 
<br> a faucet, or even just a couple of buckets of water.
<br>Afterthat you need to completely cover the dog in <br>
water makeing sure that the dog is covered totally.
</p> </p></p></p></p></p>
</h><h3 style="background-color:#73C6B6"> Step Two </h3> 
<p style="text-align:center" ">After you have finished covering 
the dog with water<br> you need to lather the dog with soap makeing 
sure to<br> scrub the soap in to the fur of the dog. When lathering 
the <br>dog with soap be sure to cover the dog with an equal <br>      
 amount of soap. </p>
 
 </h><h3 style="background-color:#73C6B6"> Step Three </h3>
 <p style="text-align:center" "> After you have scrubbed the soap into
 the dog's fur<br> you want to use water and completely rinse out the
 <br> fur of the dog. While you are rinseing the fur make 
 <br> scrub out all of the soap because if the soap is left 
 <br> in the fur it could dry and irritate the skin on the 
 <br> dog. After you have finished rinseing the dog repeat 
 <br> step three two times.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
 
  </h><h3 style="background-color:#73C6B6"> Step Four  </h3>
<p style="text-align:center" "> After you have completed step three 
three times<br> you should work on drying the dog off
<br> with the towels. Depending on the size of the dog you
<br> have tells you how many towels to use you really just want 
<br> dry the dog off until the dog is almost completely dry.
<br> Here is a link to some dog shampoo

</h><h3 style="background-color:#73C6B6"> Step Five </h3>
<p style="text-align:center" "> When the dog is almost completely dry 
you want to use the brush <br> to completely brush out any knots or 
matted areas of the dog. You also <br>Want to use the comb to 
comb out the dog's paws. Finally you have 
<br>a clean and groomed Dog.</p></p></p>
